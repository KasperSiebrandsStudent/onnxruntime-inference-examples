# When the application calls ort.register_execution_provider_library() with the path to the plugin EP DLL,
# ORT internally uses LoadLibraryExW() to load that DLL. Since the plugin EP depends on onnxruntime.dll,
# the operating system will attempt to locate and load onnxruntime.dll first.
#
# On Windows, LoadLibraryExW() searches the directory containing the plugin EP DLL before searching system directories.
# Because onnxruntime.dll is not located in the plugin EP’s directory, Windows ends up loading the copy from a 
# system directory instead—which is not the correct version.
#
# To ensure the plugin EP uses the correct onnxruntime.dll bundled with the ONNX Runtime package, 
# we load that DLL explicitly before loading the plugin EP DLL.
